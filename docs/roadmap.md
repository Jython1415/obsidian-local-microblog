# Obsidian Local Microblog Plugin - Development Roadmap

## Current Status

**Core Functionality: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ Phase 4A: Data structure redesign with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Phase 4B: Timeline view simplification (top-level posts only)
- ✅ Phase 4C: Post view implementation with context chains
- ✅ Phase 4D: State management and navigation
- ✅ Bug fixes: Context chain display for deeply nested replies (4th+ levels)

**System Status:** Fully functional two-view microblog system with robust threading support.

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 5: Polish & UX)

### High Priority
1. **Enhanced Visual Highlighting**
   - Improve focused post styling with Bluesky-inspired focus patterns
   - Better visual hierarchy for context chains
   - Enhanced post type indicators (reply/quote/original)

2. **Error Status Indicators**
   - Visual indicators for posts with `hasErrors` flag
   - User-friendly error messages for orphaned replies and circular references
   - Clear indication of data integrity issues

3. **Visual Design Polish**
   - Refined spacing and typography in both Timeline and Post views
   - Consistent color scheme and styling
   - Improved button and interaction states

### Medium Priority
4. **Timeline Creation UX Integration**
   - Add "Reply" and "Quote" buttons to timeline posts
   - Integrate with existing command-based creation system
   - "New Post" button in timeline header
   - Timeline refresh after post creation

5. **Enhanced Navigation**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Improved back/forward navigation in Post view
   - Navigation breadcrumbs for deep thread exploration

## Long-term Vision

### Advanced Threading Features
- **Thread Summarization**: Auto-generated summaries for very long threads
- **Thread Search**: Search within specific conversation threads
- **Thread Export**: Export conversation threads as standalone documents
- **Branch Visualization**: Better visual representation of conversation branches

### Content Enhancement
- **Quote System Expansion**: Full implementation of quote post functionality
- **Rich Media Support**: Image and attachment handling in posts
- **Link Preview**: Auto-preview of linked content within posts
- **Hashtag System**: Tag-based post organization and discovery

### Performance & Scale
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large numbers of posts efficiently
- **Incremental Loading**: Load posts on-demand for better performance
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduce memory footprint for large datasets
- **Background Sync**: Real-time updates when posts are created outside the plugin

### Integration Features
- **External Import/Export**: Import from Twitter, Mastodon, etc.
- **Cross-Vault Linking**: Reference posts from other Obsidian vaults
- **API Development**: Allow other plugins to interact with microblog data
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface improvements

### Advanced UX
- **Customizable Views**: User-configurable timeline layouts
- **Filtering System**: Filter by date, type, tags, or conversation participants
- **Notification System**: Alerts for new replies to your posts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Post engagement and conversation metrics

## Implementation Philosophy

### Incremental Enhancement
- Build on solid foundation of current working system
- Each phase adds value without breaking existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing post data

### User-Centric Design
- Prioritize common use cases and workflows
- Maintain simplicity while adding power features
- Focus on reducing friction in content creation and discovery

### Technical Excellence
- Maintain clean, readable codebase
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Performance considerations for scaling to hundreds of posts

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Obsidian modal and plugin API limitations
- File system as single source of truth
- Maintain compatibility with manual file editing

### Design Constraints
- Two-view system architecture (Timeline + Post View)
- Command-based creation workflow
- Local-first, no external dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (Phase 5)
- Visual polish comparable to modern social media interfaces
- Clear error states and user guidance
- Enhanced user satisfaction with threading experience

### Long-term
- Support for 500+ posts without performance degradation
- Rich content creation and discovery workflows
- Extensible architecture for community contributions
